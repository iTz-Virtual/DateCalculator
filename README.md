# DateCalculator 
A simple calculator between two dates in python! 
Please use the format dd/mm/yyyy.



# Known Bugs
If you're using a keyboard with US International layout and you press any apostrophe the program will crash with KeyError: "undefined character name 'COMBINING APOSTROPHE'"
or similar. I'm waiting for a pyinput update to fix this bug.
